PE 7 (diagramming an application)
=========================

This is an individual assignment.

The Program
----------
We have [provided](pe7_code/) a program that lets a user electronically shop at a store. The program that you are given is not be complete (there will be no money or goods actually being exchanged, the software only allows one person to shop at the store at any one time), but it does let one person visit the store and make purchases.


Program Flow:
1. When the program starts, the user implicitly enters the given store.
2. The user then has the choice to do any of the following things:
    1. Display inventory
    2. Add item to cart
    3. Remove item from cart
    4. Checkout
    5. Leave
The user can do any number of this task in any order until they leave the store, at which point the program exits.

Task 1 - Diagram
------
Your first task is to create a diagram of all the classes involved with this software and how they communicate with each other. You donâ€™t have to follow a formal diagramming schema to create this picture.

Your diagram must include:
1. Every class and every method it contains
2. For every method, which other method(s) it calls

Your diagram may be handwritten, but must be legible. Poorly lit photos will not be accepted.

Task 2 - Clone()
------
Take a look at the `Clone()` method in Item. What does this method do? Why do you think that it is included in this class definition? Write your answer on the diagram that you created for the first question of this part.


Task 3 - 5 "c"s
--------
Using the table that you filled out when you critiqued Homework 1 during [lecture 11](../lectures/11_mazecritique_inheritance/11_mazecritique.pdf) as a guide, create a table for all objects given to you in this program and fill it out, arguing for whether or not each one is cohesive, complete, clear, convenient, and consistent.


__Turn in__:
    - A well-organized pdf with your answers to the 3 tasks above.
